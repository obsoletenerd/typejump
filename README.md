# Typejump

Typejump is a small game to introduce kids to computer keyboards. A single-letter-at-a-time typing tutor.

Built for, tested by, and approved by my 5 year old.

The character automatically walks forward, and stops at an obstacle with a letter displayed. When the player presses the matching letter on the keyboard (case is irrelevant), the character jumps the obstacle and continues. 

There are currently 3 levels. I plan on eventually adding more, and some progressive difficulty (2 letter words, then 3 letter words, etc), but my kids already love playing this as-is so in the spirit of "perfect is the enemy of good", I decided this is good enough for now.

## How to Play

Download [Typejump (Alpha).zip](https://github.com/obsoletenerd/typejump/blob/master/Typejump%20(Alpha).zip), unzip all files to a folder, run the EXE.

Windows 10 only for now, I plan on making builds for MacOS and Linux soon.

If you don't trust the EXE you can clone the repo, then in Game Maker Studio 2 open the YPP file from the Source folder and press F5 to compile and run.

### Keys

* SPACE to start a level
* F5 to restart the game (if you get stuck or get to the end)
* F12 to skip to the next level
* ESC to quit
